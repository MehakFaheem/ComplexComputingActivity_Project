# 🏥 End-to-End Medical Triage Assistant (with Explainability)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an **end-to-end medical risk triage assistant** that predicts **stroke risk** using structured Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data. The system classifies patients into **Low**, **Medium**, and **High risk** categories and provides **explainable predictions** to support transparent clinical decision-making.

The project demonstrates a complete applied machine learning pipeline including preprocessing, class imbalance handling, model comparison, probability calibration, and explainable AI (XAI).

> ⚠️ This system is intended as a **clinical decision-support tool**, not a diagnostic replacement for healthcare professionals.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Predict patient stroke risk using tabular EMR data
* Handle severe class imbalance in medical datasets
* Compare multiple machine learning models
* Calibrate predicted probabilities for reliable risk estimation
* Provide explainable predictions using SHAP
* Build a practical risk-based triage system

---

## 🧠 Models Used

The following models were implemented and evaluated:

* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine (RBF Kernel)
* Random Forest (**selected as best model**)
* Gaussian Naive Bayes

Model selection was based on **ROC-AUC** and **Precision-Recall performance**, which are more suitable for imbalanced medical data.

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

* Removed non-informative ID column
* Handled missing values (BMI median imputation)
* One-Hot Encoding for categorical features
* StandardScaler for numerical features
* Stratified train-test split
* SMOTE applied **only on training data**

---

## ⚖️ Class Imbalance Handling

The dataset exhibits severe class imbalance.
To address this:

* **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** was applied to the training set only
* Evaluation metrics beyond accuracy were emphasized

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

The following metrics were used:

* Accuracy
* ROC-AUC Curve
* Precision-Recall Curve
* Confusion Matrix

These metrics help assess model performance under imbalanced conditions.

---

## 🔧 Probability Calibration

* **Isotonic Regression** was applied to calibrate predicted probabilities
* Calibration ensures that predicted risk percentages better reflect real-world risk
* Calibrated probabilities are used for final triage decisions

## 🚦 Risk Triage System

Based on calibrated probabilities, patients are categorized as:

| Risk Level | Probability Range | Recommended Action           |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Low        | < 20%             | Routine monitoring           |
| Medium     | 20% – 60%         | Scheduled follow-up          |
| High       | > 60%             | Immediate clinical attention |

---

## 🔍 Explainability & Interpretability (SHAP)

To ensure transparency and trust:

* **Global Explainability**: SHAP summary plots identify overall risk-driving features
* **Local Explainability**: SHAP waterfall and force plots explain individual predictions

SHAP explanations are generated from the Random Forest model, while calibrated probabilities are used for risk communication.

---

## ⚠️ Ethical Considerations

* Patient data is assumed to be anonymized and used strictly for academic purposes
* The model may inherit bias from the dataset and requires continuous monitoring
* Human oversight is mandatory; clinicians make final decisions
* Explainability supports ethical requirements such as transparency and accountability
